Also to do:
- play with datatbase, have it build a model to test
- look at how model did based on 2024 predictions

- big dataset to train the model, portion to test it (Machine learning)
    - (will it be trained on the reg season, tourney in test?. like split in half?)
    - or will part of tourney be bart of test
- it will determine which values are more worthy for prediction (weight)
    - ex. point diff over the year is more important to deternmine performance
- use data from prev years, use data from tourney to determine how well model is actually behaving
- how well is model gonna predict how well each team does in the tournament
    - this will be used to test how good our model is, were we able to predict the winners accurately
- how good is relative team performance, like UConn has been good for years, vs. random teams that just show up
- 70% of the time, the favorites win
- test 1 v 16, 2 v15, in my head the numbers should go down as you get closer

Variables to check:
- check to see if weight needed for players that have been w/ team longer
- try to find point diff?
- diff buckets
    - how does team do statistically
    - strength of schedule/conference
    - coach success rates
    - AP + other rankings (net), how important are those
        - 192 types of rankings, do they play a part
    - tournament seeding, does that play a role
