Also to do:
- play with datatbase, have it build a model to test
- look at how model did based on 2024 predictions

- big dataset to train the model, portion to test it (Machine learning)
    - (will it be trained on the reg season, tourney in test?. like split in half?)
    - or will part of tourney be bart of test
- it will determine which values are more worthy for prediction (weight)
    - ex. point diff over the year is more important to deternmine performance
- use data from prev years, use data from tourney to determine how well model is actually behaving
- how well is model gonna predict how well each team does in the tournament
    - this will be used to test how good our model is, were we able to predict the winners accurately
- how good is relative team performance, like UConn has been good for years, vs. random teams that just show up
- 70% of the time, the favorites win
- test 1 v 16, 2 v15, in my head the numbers should go down as you get closer

Variables to check:
- check to see if weight needed for players that have been w/ team longer
- try to find point diff?
- diff buckets
    - how does team do statistically
    - strength of schedule/conference
    - coach success rates
    - AP + other rankings (net), how important are those
        - 192 types of rankings, do they play a part
    - tournament seeding, does that play a role

next prompt:
can you implement these improvements in accuracy for me? take into account all of the variables and thoughts i had in the notes.txt file. like taking into account rankings, strength of scheul, player experince, coach success rates, sats of the teams, conference strength, stuff like this. take all of this into account. how good is realtive team performance (uconn consistently good, random schools like oakland that had a good run) stuff like this please look at all of this in detail and do everything you can to increase the accuracy.

longer prompt all included: also, this was my output for running it last time:Library

several key issues with this. why does it keep saying no data found for the season 2021, using 2010.0 instead. and it does this for the next 4 up until 2025. could this be because it isnt checking for 2021.0? its doing 2021 insetad of 2021.0? idk, but maybe, because stuff like this: "No stats found for season 2023, using season 2010.0 instead" should not be happening. you have data for everything. fix this issue, it does this with the years from 2021 and onward when checking. make it so it can find the stats for all the seasons. becasue it keeps using 2010.0, i believe the results are faulty, as it keeps repetitively using stats from a previous season, let alone the same one, and its wrong. have it check the proper season's data its analyzing. also, i believe there will be seeding available to give you at a later time? because the official bracket is out already.

because when running the file with cursor, i get these lines at the end: "Additional Analysis:

Analyzing model performance by seed matchup (Men's):
No seed matchup data available for analysis

Analyzing model performance by seed matchup (Women's):
No seed matchup data available for analysis". is this because what i gave u has no seeding yet? once you fix the issue with the 2010.0 season repetitvely being checked, implement this into the final product as well:
