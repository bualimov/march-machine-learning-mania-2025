Notes:
- look at how model did based on 2024 predictions
- we should determine which values are more worthy for prediction (weight)
  - ex. point diff over the year is more important to deternmine performance over other variables
- how well is model gonna predict how well each team does in the tournament?
  - this will be used to test how good our model is, were we able to predict the winners accurately
- figure out the proper weights of all variables and metrics in question
- i do not have the seeding for 2025 yet, we can do that later
- do not at all every just resort to soing 0.5 for every single team
  - actually do the analsyis with all of the variables i describe

Questions:
- big dataset to train the model, which portion will be used to test it (Machine learning)
  - (will it be trained on the reg season, or previous tournaments for testing? like split in half maybe?)
  - or only exclusively train by looking at past tournaments, and then comparing the actual results?
- use data from prev years, use data from tourney to determine how well model is actually behaving

- how good is relative team performance, like UConn has been good for years, vs. random teams that just show up?
  - look into how maybe, 70% of the time, the favorites win, and how much is THAT gonna matter
- test 1 v 16, 2 v 15, (seeding-wise) in my head the numbers should go down as you get closer

Variables to check:
- check to see players that have been w/ team longer, if they are with the team longer, 
  - does a more experienced team -> more success? if yes, hold the weight high, otherwise not
- try to find team's statistical details like:
  - point differential throughout the season?
  - lets say a team finishes with a +200 points total and is in the tournamnet.
  - and their opponent has a -150 points differntial and is in the tournament. does it matter?
  - determine head to head mathcups too, if they played each other recent years, trends, one team usually wins or no? if so, take that into account?
- organize this stuff into different buckets, each holding respected different weights. for example:
  - stats would hold .2 weight. rankings hold .25 weight. coach success rates hold .1 weight. all of this would be used to create the probability, from 0 to 1, that a team would win.
    - how does team do statistically throughout the season
    - strength of schedule/conference
    - coach success rates
    - AP + other rankings (net), how important are those
        - 192 types of rankings, do they play a part at all
    - tournament seeding, does that play a role 
    - recency 

General targeted approach:
- read in all data and understand it. all of the csv files, get an understanding for the data.
  - the teams (both mens and womens)
  - the way data is being stored (in some situations, years are stored as floats vs ints for some reason)
  - what the data means, (i will paste in guidelines for data definitions)
  - conferences, stats for the teams, cities, submission samples, team id's all of this info is important
  - tournament seeding, how it works, how many teams make it
- after reading in data, read in all of the directions and guidelines.
- read in this entire notes file, get an indepth understanding of what the project submission needs to look like, and my thoughts and notes
- be detailed in explaining everything, work towards a solution, EXPLAIN EVERYTHING IN DETAIL
- take in all of the variables and metrics i discussed.
